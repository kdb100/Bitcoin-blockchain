A Blockchain and Cryptocurrency network similar to Bitcoin & Dogecoin

The blockchain is a revolutionary technology that allows for the secure, distributed, decentralized storage of information. 

This blockchain project:
- Is built in the object-oriented programming style.
- Generates hashes for blocks in the chain.
- Creates a real-time connected peer-to-peer server.
- Implements a proof-of-work algorithm.
- Signs Transactions with cryptography and digital signature.
- Creates a Transaction Pool for a real-time list of incoming data.
- Include stransactions in core blocks of the chain.

I hope to work on other blockchains with proof of stake & space concensus.
